C++ Class
In C++, class is a group of similar objects. 
It is a template from which objects are created. It can have 
fields, methods, constructors etc.

Let's see an example of C++ class that has three fields only.

class Student    
 {    
     public:  
     int id;  //field or data member     
     float salary; //field or data member  
     String name;//field or data member    
 }
