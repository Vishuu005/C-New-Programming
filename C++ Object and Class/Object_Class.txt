C++ Object and Class
Since C++ is an object-oriented language, program is designed using objects and classes in C++.

C++ Object
In C++, Object is a real world entity, for example, chair, car, pen, mobile, laptop etc.

In other words, object is an entity that has state and behavior. Here, state means data and behavior means functionality.

Object is a runtime entity, it is created at runtime.

Object is an instance of a class. All the members of the class can be accessed through object.

Let's see an example to create object of student class using s1 as the reference variable.

Student s1;  //creating an object of Student      
In this example, Student is the type and s1 is the reference variable that refers to the instance of Student class.
