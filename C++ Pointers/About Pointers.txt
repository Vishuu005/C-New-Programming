Advantage of pointer

1) Pointer reduces the code and improves the performance, it is used to retrieving strings, trees etc. and used with arrays, structures and functions.

2) We can return multiple values from function using pointer.

3) It makes you able to access any memory location in the computer's memory.

Usage of pointer

There are many usage of pointers in C++ language.

1) Dynamic memory allocation

In c language, we can dynamically allocate memory using malloc() and calloc() functions where pointer is used.

2) Arrays, Functions and Structures

Pointers in c language are widely used in arrays, functions and structures. It reduces the code and improves the performance.

Symbols used in pointer
Symbol	Name	Description
& (ampersand sign)	Address operator	Determine the address of a variable.
∗ (asterisk sign)	Indirection operator	Access the value of an address.
Declaring a pointer
The pointer in C++ language can be declared using ∗ (asterisk symbol).

int ∗   a; //pointer to int    
char ∗  c; //pointer to char
